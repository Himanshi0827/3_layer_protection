# Python  Steganography  Tool

This Python application provides a user-friendly interface for hiding and retrieving data from images using steganography techniques. The project is built using the Tkinter library for the GUI, PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image processing, and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for encryption and decryption.

## Features

- Encode: Hide text data within an image using steganography.
- Decode: Retrieve hidden text data from an encoded image.
- Encryption: Encrypt the hidden data using AES for added security.
- Random Key Generation: Generate a random AES key for encryption.
- Browse Images: Select images easily using the file dialog.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive GUI for smooth user interaction.
The Python Steganography Tool is a desktop application designed to hide and retrieve text data within image files using steganography techniques. Steganography is the practice of concealing information within other non-secret data, such as images, to ensure data security and privacy.

Key Features:
Encoding Data: Users can encode text data into an image, making it appear as a normal image while secretly carrying the hidden information.
Decoding Data: The tool allows users to decode hidden text data from an encoded image, revealing the concealed information.
Encryption: Optionally, users can encrypt the hidden data using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for enhanced security. This ensures that even if the hidden information is discovered, it remains secure and unreadable without the correct decryption key.
Random Key Generation: The tool generates a random AES key for encryption, ensuring unpredictability and robust security measures.
Browse Images: Users can easily select image files using a file dialog, simplifying the process of choosing the input and output images for encoding and decoding.
User-Friendly Interface: The application features a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library, making it accessible and easy to use for users of all levels of expertise.
How It Works:
Encoding Process: The user selects an image file and inputs the text data they wish to hide, along with an optional AES encryption key. The application then embeds the text data into the image using steganography techniques, creating an encoded image file.
Decoding Process: To retrieve the hidden text data, the user selects the encoded image file and, if encrypted, provides the correct AES decryption key. The application then extracts and displays the hidden text data from the image, allowing the user to access the concealed information.
Technologies Used:
Python: The core programming language used for developing the application.
Tkinter: A standard GUI toolkit for Python used to create the graphical user interface of the application.
PIL (Python Imaging Library) / Pillow: Used for image processing functionalities, such as loading, saving, and modifying images.
PyCryptodome: Provides AES encryption and decryption capabilities, ensuring secure handling of sensitive data within the encoded images.
Purpose:
The Python Steganography Tool serves as a practical and educational tool for individuals interested in data security, cryptography, and digital forensics. It demonstrates the concepts of steganography and encryption in a hands-on manner, allowing users to explore and experiment with hiding and revealing information within images while ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-steganography-tool.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd python-steganography-tool
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install Pillow pycryptodome
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
python stegano_tool.py
```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to encode, decode, and encrypt/decrypt data in images.

## Usage

1. **Encode:** Select an image, enter the text data to hide, and provide an AES key for encryption (optional).
2. **Decode:** Choose an image with hidden data, enter the correct AES key (if encrypted), and retrieve the hidden text.
3. **Encryption:** When encoding, you can choose to encrypt the hidden data using AES for added security.
